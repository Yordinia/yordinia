# My pen testing journey

Based on what I asked chat GPT
- question 
    - I want to become a pen tester. I have 3 months to prepare and become the best self-thought pentester. as I can be. Your task is to give an extremely in-depth learning plan to help me improve my pen testing skills in 3 months.  Create a focused learning plan for me using the Pareto principle.
    - You must include what I'm doing each day and for how long I should practice it and design the learning plan with the goal to make me a better, more rounded technician. I want to focus on the offensive side of penetration testing web apps as I have a background in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I would like a project-based learning style. I am also a visual learner. Please write the lesson plan out now.

- And it answered
    - Certainly! Here's an in-depth learning plan using the Pareto principle to help you become a self-taught penetration tester in three months.

Month 3: Consolidation and Real-World Application

Week 1-2:

Day 1-10: Penetration Testing Projects (2 hours per day)
Engage in real-world web application penetration testing projects.
Choose vulnerable web applications or participate in bug bounty programs to gain practical experience.
Apply the skills and knowledge gained in the previous months to conduct thorough penetration tests and produce high-quality reports.
Week 3:

Day 1-4: Continuous Learning and Improvement (1 hour per day)
Stay updated with the latest web application vulnerabilities, exploitation techniques, and security tools.
Follow security blogs, participate in forums or online communities, and read relevant research papers.
Continuously refine your skills by practicing on vulnerable applications, joining Capture The Flag (CTF) competitions, or contributing to open-source security projects.
Remember to adapt the learning plan based on your progress, interests, and available resources. Regularly assess your skills and adjust the plan accordingly to focus on areas that need improvement. Good luck on your journey to becoming a skilled self-taught penetration tester!
