# JOB
A flow is a container of 1 or more entities called steps.
it may have its own attributes, in addition to steps and interatcions
> name
> validity period
> creation / lauchend date
## A Step 
is what interacts with the user  and does multiple things
the following are Conversation Types
>  EchoStep (Display simple message)
        and automaticaly progress to the next step  
> ChoiceStep (promp user choice)    
        tkae the user to a differet step based on the user input
> Take a user to another step (GotoStep)
        **if we want to get back to a different step
> End a conversation (EndStep)
        Cleans sessions and finishes conversations

## Use Cases

### Vote Flow 
>> Welcome(EchoStep) | Ask (explian) - Split (Choices) - End (each choice)
Set up a flow with the following steps:
● EchoStep
● ChoiceStep
● EndStep
The choice step will have an optional brief text that describes the purpose of the vote along with
selectable choices for the items to vote. Each choice will be mapped to EchoStep to thank the
user for participation. And each EchoStep will be mapped to an EndStep that ends the
conversation.

### Q&A Flow
>> Surveys, Polls, Vote
EchoStep
○ First prompt and final thank you messages
● ChoiceStep
○ As many steps as there are questions.
● GotoStep
○ If we want to give a chance to review previous answers
● EndStep
○ To end the Q&A

## Microservices
> Easy Scaling and testing


### Assignment
● Build a microservice that manages flows and steps using RESTful APIs.
    ○ It’s enough to implement EchoStep, ChoiceStep, GotoStep and EndStep
    ○ Use spring boot (https://spring.io/projects/spring-boot/)
> Step 1
designing and implementing controllers, services, and models




# Spring Boot NOtes

##  embedded servers

## to change port in resources/application.yml
        server:
          port: 3000
  ## to configure embedded webserver 

    spring:
      main: 
         web-application-type: servlet

## to stop application
     web-application-type: none

## my first API
to create class in java
public String greet() {
    return "Hello greet"
}
To expose this method as a rest endpoint (get request client) -
@GetMapping("/")
then  greet()  function below...
and add @RestController above Main 
if u say, @GetMapping("/greet")
your url becomes localhost:8080/greet

## Annotations
@SpringBootApplication
is a wrapper for 
- @Configuration: database connection details
- @EnableAutoConfiguration: guesses the confg ased on JAR files available on  hte classpath, knws what librries u use, and pre-configures their componts
- @ComponentScan: telling spring where to look for components
its important to put componnents in the same package

## creating aliasses for annotations
@AliasFor(
    annotation = Configuration.class
    or
    annotation = ComponentScan.class // or 
)
### without springBootapp notation
@ComponentScan(basePackages  = 'com.firstspringboot')
@Enable. ..  

# Spring MVC
abstracts process of handling HTTP requests/responses
## annotations
@Controller - auto-detects implementation classes/beans by scanning the classpath
@RestController 
- contails @Controller and @ResponseBody 
- indicates the class is  a controller & that all the methods will return a JSON response
@requestMapping(method=RequestMethod.GET, value='/path')  is the same as @GetMapping(value='/path')
@PostMapping(value='path')
@DeleteMapping(value='path')
@RequestParamMapping(value=name, defaultValue="world")

## to return JSON apis / objects
use 
public GreetResponse greet(){
    return new GreetResponse("hello")
}
record GreetResponse(String greet){}
## record 
-  is a feature introduced in Java 16 for a more concise way to declare classes that are mainly used to store data.
## without record
constructor
class MyClass{
   //varuable
    private final String greet;

    //construc
    public MyClass(String greet){
        this.greet = greet
    }
    // getter
    public String getMyClass(){
        return greet;
    }
     // to String (JSON format)
     @override
     public String toString(){
        return "GreetResponse{" +"gret='" + greet ... .}
     }
    / / equals and hash code
    use shortcut generate
}
## ////////JACKSON complicated json
@GetMapping("/greet")
public GreetResponse greet(){
    return new GreetResponse(
        greet: "Hello",
        List.of("Java", "Golang", "JavaScript"),
        new Person(name: "Alex", age: 28, savings: 30_000.0)
    )
}

record Person(String name, int age, double savings){

}
record GreetResponse (
    String greet,
    List<String> favProgrammingLanguages
    Person person
)

## Putting all together, MODEL, CRUD with API
new class after Main
pub class Customer{
    private Integer id;
    private String name;
    private String email;
    private Integer age; 
    
    > alt + enter for constructors
    create
     public Customer() {}
    > generate setters and getters
    > generate equals, hashcode and tostring()
}

>> model - client will be able to request a fetch request to our api

>> 
## DataBase Connection with out SQL code
root file
+ docker-compose.yml
check 
>> run
>> docker-compose up
commands
>> docker compose ps
>> docker logs postgres -f
docker-compose will help us service postgres instance running on docker
check if docker is running
>> docker run -d -p 80:80 docker/getting-started

## Configure spring application to Connect to this DB
