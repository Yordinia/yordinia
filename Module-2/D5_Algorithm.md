# Getting started with Big O Notation using Linear Search and Binary Search examples

[summerize](https://towardsdatascience.com/introduction-to-big-o-notation-820d2e25d3fd)

# Big O
- Measure an algorithmâ€™s efficiency, while input grows
- How well does the function scale

### Big-O space complexity
- Measures how much space the algorithm requires as it grows.
### Big-O time complexity
- Measures how quickly the duration of the algorithm grows, relative to the input size.



Linear Search Example 
- start from 0 trought 10
- Big O notation = O(N)
- complexity > directly related to size

Binary Search Example
- Find and compare from a random midpoint
- requires the list to be ordered
- Big O notation = O(log N)

### Computational Thinking [source](https://youtu.be/jjqgP9dpD1k)
- Process of SOLVING PROBLEM [input ~~~ output]
- representing anything (text, image, music in a computer)
    - Dec=10, Bit(binary)=zeroes&ones, 1 byte = 8 bit, A=65[1000001]
    - Unicode [laughing_emojie>1285] > superset of ASCII
    - U send laughing_emo bit, your friend's android shows the emojie
    - RGB > stored for each pixed of an image
    - Videos & gifs > repetetion of images
    - Music > quantize the notes ur playing> Piano [notes-ABCD] , [how-long], [volume]
