### Git Commands
<details>
<summary>Git Stash</summary>

- stash ``` git stash ```
- to stash untracked files (such us newly created files) ```git stash -u```
- To stash with a custom message```git stash push -m "Initialize project using Create APP"```

get / use files
- To get the stashed files back ``` git stash apply 0``` 0 is [index]
- pop the last one into our dir and remove it from stash stack``` git stash pop ```
- To create a new branch from a stash ``` git stash branch new-branch 0```

To see stash
- To list all the stash changes ``` git stash list```
- If we only have 1 stash ``` stash(0) on a branch: 3030399```
- Show us the changes in a specific stash ``` git stash show 0```
- With preview ``` git stash show -p 0 ```

- Remove stash ``` git stash clear```
- drop specific stash ``` git stash drop 0```

- [Additional Commands](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-stash)

</details>
<details>
<summary>Git reset and -- </summary>

- `git reset .` : This command is used to unstage changes in the current branch. It removes the changes from the staging area (index) without modifying the working directory. It essentially resets the staging area to match the last commit while leaving the modified files in the working directory untouched.

- `git checkout -- .` : This command is used to discard local changes in all files within the current directory and its subdirectories. It effectively reverts the modified files back to the state they were in when you last committed or checked out the branch. The . represents the current directory, and the -- separates the command from the file paths.

### Extensions
    - 


# JSON
<details>
<summary> Json server </summary>
Install JSON server globally

 - ```npm install -g json-server```

create db.json file with data, give it sample json file

```
{
    "Users": [
        {
            "id": 0,
            "name": "Mar"
        }
    ]
}
```
 - Link [here](https://github.com/typicode/json-server)

- run Json server ```json-server --watch db.json```

</details>

### What is JSON
- Has exact JavaScript Object syntax, except properties are always in quotes "file.json":{ "lat": -42, "lon":30}
- 
-

### API 
- More API examples we used for capstone and more - here ([link to capstone.md](Module-2\W5\capstone.md#APIs))

- fetch syntax
```
fetch('https://reqres.in/api/users')
.then(res=> {
    if(res.ok){
        console.log('successful')
    } else{
        console.log('not successful")
    }
}).then(data=> console.log(data))
  .catch( error =>console.log('error'))//fetch error never happens unless there;s api link error..
```
### POST, GET, PUT
<details>
<summary> POST </summary>

- To post data to our server, we're going to NEED TO USE the OPTION section of the fetch method (as a second argument), and pass an object.
```
fetch('https://reqres.in/api/users', {
    method: POST, //creates a new user in the api
    body: JSON.stringify({
        name: 'User 1'
    }) // data for that user
}).then(res=> {
    return res.json()
}).then(data=> console.log(data))
  .catch( error =>console.log('error'))
```
- or, in anothe ecample / format
```
const apiUrl = "https://us-central1-involvement-api.cloudfunctions.net/capstoneApi/apps/";

const response = await fetch(apiUrl, {
  method: 'POST',
  headers: {
    'Content-Type': 'application/json',
  },
  body: JSON.stringify({name: 'mealdb-id'}),
})
const {mealdb-id} = await response.json();

if(response.ok) console.log('successful', mealdb-id)
else  console.log('Error, failed', mealdb-id)


// microverse LeaderBoard API
const apiUrl = 'https://us-central1-js-capstone-backend.cloudfunctions.net/api/';
const response = await fetch(`${apiUrl}games/`, {
      method: 'POST',
      headers: {
        'Content-Type': 'application/json',
      },
      body: JSON.stringify({ name: 'Game-ID' }),
    });
    const res = await response.json();
    gameId = res.result;  
```

## Headers in responses
- To check the content type of a response body
`response.headers.get('Content-type')`
- To check the length
`response.headers.get('Content-length')`
- to compare weather its `text/html` or `application/json`
    - ` response.headers.get('Content-type') === 'text/html'`
    - ` response.headers.get('Content-type') === 'application/json'`

# Rest
<details>
<summary> What is rest </summary>

- REST (Representational State Transfer) is an architectural style and set of principles for designing networked applications.
- Used in Web dev to build APIs, that allows d/t software systems to communicate & interact with each other over HTTP protocol.
- RESTful APIs are designed around a few key principles:
    - Resource-based: REST treats data as resources that can be identified and accessed through URLs (Uniform Resource Locators).

    - Stateless: Each request from a client to a server should contain all the necessary information for the server to understand and process the request. The server should not store any client-specific information between requests.

    - Uniform interface: RESTful APIs follow a standardized set of HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) to perform operations on resources. These methods are mapped to CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations.

    - Client-Server architecture: The client and server are separate entities that communicate over a network. The client is responsible for the user interface and user interactions, while the server manages resources and performs necessary actions.

    - Cacheable: REST APIs can take advantage of caching to improve performance. Responses from the server can be stored by the client or intermediate servers to be reused for subsequent requests.

- Chat GPT became my tutor
    - design a custom design for you
    - first attempt - give me study plan to learn android dev
    - 2nd 1 - give me study plan to python for data science with resources
- Provide who, what, when, where why - Study Plan Framework
    - who -  what's the role of chat GPT in giving you a study plan
    - what - to learn, when - time, where - online, why
- GPT command for study plan
>GPT: Act as a coding tutor that creates study plans to help people learn to code. You will be provided with the goal of the student, their time commitment, and resorce preferences. You will create a study plan with timelines and links to resources. OOnly include relevant resources because time is limited. My first request - " I want to become a data scientist but I do not know how to code. I can study 10 hours per week and only want video resources. I want to learn to code in p ython. create a study plan for me.

- Chat GPT Project Ideas
    - Say you've now learn, and you want to do a project.
    - If you want to find a project to do about Naruto

React general syntax

```
import React, {Component} from 'react';
class MyApp extends Component{
    constructor(){
        super()
