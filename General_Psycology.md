## If anyone is reading this ! :lightbulb: 
- I really need help in practicing all the non-technical things that microverse is teaching us
- Here are some topics I would really like to discuss with / or to read more about 
    - `Making SMART goals` > if anyone has sample SMART goals that you fill in your `Weekly retrospectives` I would really appreciate it, as I feel my goals are not making any effect as they're too broad.
    - `Better Code Review notes` if you have thought about - Bringing a healthy code review mindset to your team. I read also that conversation in Pull Request will be checked by some recruiters in the future.
    - `Showcase the breadth of technologies that you master ` .. how to best do that?
    - How to no sound robotic when giving an `elevator pitch` > What are the best information to include in your speech 
        > Practice reciting your pitch with your eyes closed and by making silly faces or by smiling while making the pitch. >> Is that really neccesarry?
    - `Time management` > all that we've learned > `Pomodoro` ? .. `The 4 quadrant method` and `Time blocking` . .? If anyone has a habit of doing these things, can you share!
