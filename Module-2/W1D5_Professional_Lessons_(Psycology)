  - **General support:** Some mentors like to provide a space where the mentee has concerns that are not tech-related. For example, feeling excluded, anxiety, being bullied by others, dealing with imposter syndrome, and more. These mentors can contribute to a mentee's growth both personally and professionally.

- **Mentorship** is the relationship formed between two people: a mentor and a mentee, in which the mentor provides guidance or shares knowledge with the mentee and the mentee works to improve their skills or confidence.

  - What do I hope to achieve from the mentorship?
  - How much time am I willing and able to commit?
  - Do I need my mentor to be in the same time zone as me? Which timezones work well for me?
  - Should the mentorship meetings be once a week, twice a week, once a month, or ad-hoc?
  - Is this mentorship open-ended or do I just need a few sessions?
  - What will my primary method of communication be? Would it be Slack? or Zoom? or another communication method?
  - How do I want to track my progress with my mentor?
  - What type of support do I want my mentor to provide?

- **Apply strong professional skills during mentourship**
- Think about these
  - How do I show professionalism in a mentorship?
  - What skills do I and my mentor need to bring in order to have a strong mentorship relationship?
- The mentee should bring the following skills to the mentorship relationship:
  - Organization skills: make sure you are on time for your mentorship meetings.
  - Communication skills: prepare any questions you have in advance.
  - Hard work: try to make progress (big or small) before each meeting with your mentor. Bring your challenges, wins, and areas you would like to get input on from your mentor.
- The mentor, on the other hand, should aim to provide the following services in a mentorship relationship:
  - Agreed type of support: We saw in the section on setting expectations with your mentor that mentors can provide different types of support to a mentee. Depending on the type of support you both agreed on, your mentor should provide this support.
  - Accountability: The mentor should establish realistic goals with their mentee and hold them accountable for making constant progress, no matter how big or small. Accountability enables both parties to have a sense of direction and accomplishment when the goal has been attained.
  - Understanding and patience: This is necessary to keep the relationship peaceful and constructive. Being patient will allow the mentee to feel safer and more confident in their ability to grow. This, in turn, will help increase their motivation to learn more with their mentor.
  - Encouragement: Mentors should show that they understand the struggles of the mentee and provide genuine encouragement. This is really important.

  - What are the good qualities a mentor should have?
  - What signs should I look out for when choosing a mentor?
  - Do they show signs of patience? Patience is a really important skill for a mentor to have since they are going to be supporting and helping you grow.
  - Are they good communicators? Good communicators take time to listen to the mentee and their struggles, rather than just blaming them for not being able to see the solution.
  - Are they willing to listen to my story? You might be struggling with confidence and need someone to talk to about your tech issues, your bugs, and your general fears about tech. Are they willing to listen to your story?
  - Are they willing to share their story? A mentor's time, knowledge, experience, and resources are invaluable to you as a mentee as you will appreciate hearing what worked for them, what didnâ€™t work for them, and more. Is your mentor willing to share their story?
  - Do you feel comfortable asking your mentor any questions at all? This is really important to create trust in the relationship.
